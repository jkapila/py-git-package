============
Installation
============

**sourcecodes** is available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_, so installation into your python virtual environment is dead
simple:

.. code:: none

    pip install sourcecodes

Don't have a virtual environment with pip? You probably should! ``pyenv`` is your friend. Google it.


.. _compilation:

Compilation
============

There is presently no need to compile **sourcecodes**, as it's written entirely in python.

Has this changed...? If so then I dont like the color of the code block.

.. _dependson:

Depends On
============

.. code:: py
	
	numpy 
	scipy
	pandas
